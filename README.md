# LSB-Image-Steganography
  The LSB Image Steganography project is a practical implementation of data hiding techniques using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) modification method, written in
the C programming language. This project demonstrates how digital images can be used as a medium to conceal secret information without altering their visual
appearance to the human eye. By modifying the least significant bits of an image's pixel values, the hidden data remains virtually undetectable, ensuring the
confidentiality and integrity of the embedded information. This project showcases a fundamental yet effective approach to secure data communication, making it
suitable for learning and exploring the basics of steganography and data security.
  The tool is capable of encoding and decoding messages within image files while maintaining the image's original appearance. Key features include the ability to
hide textual data of varying lengths, simple error checking to ensure data integrity, and a user-friendly interface to interact with the encoding and decoding
processes. This project highlights core programming concepts such as file handling, bitwise operations, and memory management in C. It serves as an excellent
example of applying theoretical knowledge to practical applications, emphasizing the importance of secure data handling in a digital world.
